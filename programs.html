        <p>There’s no better way to learn about the birds of prey in North Texas than to meet them in person!</p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Blackland Prairie Raptor Center’s birds of prey have many years of experience introducing children and adults to the world of raptors. These hawks, owls and falcons are well trained, and with the assistance of BPRC education specialists, show you what makes them an important part of our environment.</p>

          <h2>Outreach Program</h2>
        
          <p>The presentations, approximately 45 minutes long are at your location, and are available to all schools, home school groups, youth organizations, libraries, scouts and much more. Each year we present to more than 30,000 people. We travel all over North Texas and Oklahoma. Group size can range from a few to a classroom to a whole school. For schools we recommend no more than 150 at a time and can do back-to-back programs as requested.</p>

          <h2>On-Site Programs</h2>
        
          <p>Join us at BPRC for a great day of education in a natural setting with Lavon Lake as our backdrop. We have a park with pavilions, an amphitheater, restrooms, and trails. We can offer raptor presentations as well as guided hikes through native Blackland Prairie. The prairie hikes take you through a remnant prairie considered an endangered ecosystem with plants unique to this habitat. Able to accommodate up to 300 for our on-site programs.</p>

          <h2>Events</h2>

          <p>We do many community events from small Neighborhood Night Out gatherings to large festivals (such as Irish Fest – more than 30,000). It includes a booth with our raptors out at all times to talk to visitors and show them these amazing birds up-close and the option of programs as well.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p>In August, 2004, Blackland Prairie Raptor Center was incorporated as a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization with a small but determined group of individuals and a common goal – to create a place where the people of North Texas could learn, experience and appreciate birds of prey and understand their importance in the environment as a whole.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>We began by building appropriate caging for 8 non-releasable raptors and the use of an existing shed on a Board members property approximately 70 miles northeast of Dallas. We offered educational presentations to schools, festivals, camps and environmental groups as well as anyone else interested in learning about raptors, reaching more than 5,000 people in the first year.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>BPRC signed a lease in 2007 with the US Army Corps of Engineers to use Brockdale Park on Lavon Lake to build our future. The vision was to build a facility for our education raptors, a clinic for raptor rehabilitation and a permanent education building open to the public.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>In 2013, more than 30,000 people experienced our birds of prey throughout North Texas.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Our dedicated group of volunteers has a combined total of over 30 years experience presenting raptor outreach programs as well as over 70 years of raptor rehabilitation experience.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>At this time, we are continuing our expansion of education programming and have built a permanent facility for 14 education raptors. We have completed the clinic and appropriate flight caging for the rehabilitation of injured, sick and orphaned birds of prey.  <a href="#">Learn about our education programs</a></p>
